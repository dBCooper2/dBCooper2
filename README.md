### _Studying Business Intelligence and Data Analytics at TTU_

\> Currently working an eportfolio in React and NextJS, you can find the project here @ [dBCooper.io](https://github.com/dBCooper2/dBCooper.io)

\> Learning statistical analysis for finance, check out the [Pythonic Finance](https://github.com/dBCooper2/pythonic-finance) and [Financial Modeling](https://github.com/dBCooper2/financial-modeling) for examples of my work.

\> Some class projects @ TTU that round out my skill set are the [UCEMC RFP and SWOT Analysis](https://github.com/dBCooper2/UCEMC-RFP-and-SWOT-Analysis) and the [ACME Inc. SQL](https://github.com/dBCooper2/ACME_INC_SQL) Repositories.
